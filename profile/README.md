# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there

Welcome to the software commons registry of La Fabrique des MobilitÃ©s (FabMob) <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12850311?s=200&v=4" width="30" height="30">

FabMob is a French non-profit organization that works on improving the carbon effects of our mobility using the power of commons and open source solutions.

Our actions follow the [Avoid-Shift-Improve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoid-Shift-Improve) approach, with a strong emphasis on the reduction of optional mobility.

Here are some resources to know more:
- [The FabMob website (in French)](https://lafabriquedesmobilites.fr/)
- [Our wiki, with more than a thousand resources on mobility](https://wiki.lafabriquedesmobilites.fr/wiki/Accueil)

We're strong advocates that no good solution can be developed alone, so any contribution is welcomed, be it suggestions, questions or full PRs. Pinned repos are a good place to start.
